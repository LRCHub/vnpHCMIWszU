Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
(Dilemma)
The morning light is
turning blue,
the feeling is bizarre
(Bizarre)
The night is almost over,
I still don't know where
you are
The shadows, yeah,
they keep me pretty
like a movie star
(Ha-ha-ha-ha)
Daylight makes me feel
like Dracula
(Dracula)
In the end,
I hope it's you and me
In the darkness,
I would never leave you
(Ah)
Won't ever see me in the
light of day
It's far too late,
the time has come
I'm on the verge of caving in,
I run back through the dark
Now I'm Mr. Charisma,
fuckin' Pablo Escobar
(Escobar)
My friends are saying, "Shut up,
Kevin, just get in the car"
(Kevin)
I just wanna be right where
you are
(Oh, my love)
In the end,
I hope it's you and me
In the darkness,
I would never leave
(I won't leave her)
We both saw this moment
comin' from afar
Now here we are
Run from the sunlight, Dracula
(Hey)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula
(Dracu-Dracula)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula
(Run from the sun)
He's already spectacular
(Sunlight, Dracula)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
(Ha-ha-ha-ha)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
(Dilemma)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
But please,
do you think about what
it might mean?
'Cause I dream about you in
my sleep
That you ever love someone
like me? Like me?
(Oh)
In the end,
I hope it's you and me
(Oh)
In the darkness,
I would never leave
(I won't leave her)
We both saw this moment
comin' from afar
Now here we are
So run from the sunlight,
Dracula
(Hey)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula
(Run from the sunlight, Dracula)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula
(Oh)
He's obviously spectacular
(Run from the sunlight, Dracula)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula
(Run from the sunlight, Dracula)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula
(Run from the sunlight)
He's obviously spectacular
(Run from the sunlight, Dracula)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula
(Run from the sunlight, Dracula)
Run from the sunlight, Dracula
(Run from the sunlight, Dracula)
He's already spectacular
